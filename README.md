# Harry_Potter_Invisible_cloak-
 A real-time computer vision project that recreates the Harry Potter invisible cloak effect using Python and OpenCV. It detects a specific cloth color, captures the background, and replaces the cloak area to create an invisibility illusion. A simple, fun, and educational AIML project.
